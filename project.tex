This project addresses a problem in the field of Unmanned Aircraft Systems
  dealing with assigning UAS orbits.  Given a limited number of UAVs, each
  based in specific locations -- each with specific ranges of flight and
  operating costs -- and a list of targets to surveil, how do we assign
  surveillance orbits to the UASs such that all targets are surveilled while
  keeping the UASs close enough to their base of operations that they may
  safely return, either when their mission finishes or they've exhausted their
  fuel, at minimum cost? This project attempts to integrate this application

This project addresses a problem in the field of Unmanned Aircraft Systems
(UASs) dealing with assigning UAS orbits to cover a list of targets.  Given a
limited number of UAVs, each assigned to specific units based in specific
locations -- each with specific ranges of flight and operating costs -- and a
list of targets to surveil, how do we assign surveillance orbits to the UASs
such that all targets are surveilled while keeping the UASs close enough to
their base of operations that they may safely return, either when their mission
finishes or they've exhausted their fuel, at minimum cost? This project
attempts to integrate this application domain with the set cover problem domain
and a number of algorithm domains to solve the problem efficiently.

In this paper, we implement a deterministic algorithm and a stochastic
algorithm to solve this problem. According to the No Free Lunch (NFL) Theorem,
``no search algorithm is better than a random search on the space of all
possible problems —- in other words, if a particular algorithm does better than
a random search on a particular type of problem, it will not perform as well on
another type of problem, so that all in all, its global performance on the
space of all possible problems is equivalent to a random
search.''~\cite{collet2007, wiki:nfl} Stated another way, the ``NFL results
show that if there is no assumption regarding the relation between visited and
unseen search points, efficient search and optimization is
impossible.''~\cite{igel2014} Therefore, while the implemented algorithms solve
this hyper-constrained UAS problem, there's no guarantee of their effectiveness
or efficiency in solving other related UAS problems.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:designProcess}, discusses the problem domain and UAS
application problem domain discussed briefly at the beginning of this section.
In Section~\ref{sec:initIntegration}, the Algorithm domain is discussed and the
disciplined, top-down algorithm design process from~\cite{lamontDesign,
lamontSCP, lamontMIS} is used to integrate the problem, application, and
algorithm domains ending with a coded implementation in Section~\ref{sec:code}.
Results and analysis of the implementation, tested in accordance with the
guidelines put forth in~\cite{barr2001}, can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:experiment}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes
with a summary of the project.

% PD English discussion
\subsubsection{Problem Domain Discussion}

The set cover problem is a class of problems in which one seeks to select a
minimum number of sets, at minimum cost, so that the union of all selected sets
contains all elements in the input~\cite{stern2006}.  More formally, given a
universe, or ground set of elements, ${\mathcal{R} = \lbrace r_1,\ldots,r_m
\rbrace}$ and a family of sets ${\mathcal{S} = \lbrace S_1,\ldots,S_N
\rbrace}$, a set covering of $\mathcal{R}$ exists if \[ \bigcup\limits_{i =
1}^k S_{j_i} = \mathcal{R},\]

\noindent with $S_{j_i}$ being the covering sets~\cite[pp.
39-40]{christofides1975}. Christofides further state that if, for each $S_j \in
\mathcal{S}$, ``there is associated a (positive) cost $c_j$''~\cite[p.
39]{christofides1975}, then the goal of the set cover problem is to find a set
of sets $\mathcal{S}^\prime$ which includes all $m$ elements of $\mathcal{R}$
while minimizing $\sum_{i = 1}^k c_j$~\cite{christofides1975, stern2006,
talbi2009, wiki:SCP}. 

In the classic, or un-weighted, set cover problem, all ${c_j =
1}$~\cite{stern2006}. In this paper we deal with a weighted variant of the set
cover problem, consequently, for the purposes of this paper, the term
\textit{set cover problem} is synonymous with \textit{weighted set cover
problem}, but the former is be used exclusively.

% PD symbolic set development and discussion
\subsubsection{Symbolic Set Development and Discussion} \label{sec:symbol} We
now develop a symbolic set (adapted from~\cite{christofides1975, lamontSCP})
which formalize the notation used throughout this paper and, hopefully, aid in
understanding and clarity as we progress in our development to the algorithm
and application domains.

Domains:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] $D_i$ : $(\mathcal{R,S})$
  \item[] $\mathcal{R}$ : set of $m$ elements $r$
  \item[] $\mathcal{S}$ : set of $N$ sets with costs $c$ that may cover
    $\mathcal{R}$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[] set cover : $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k S_{j_i} =
        \mathcal{R}$~\cite[Eq.~3.12]{christofides1975}\\ 
        -- union of sets cover $\mathcal{R}$
        elements
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[] $D_o$ : set of set-covers $\mathcal{S}^\prime$ of $\mathcal{R}$ with
    additive cost
\end{enumerate}

% PD $0/1$ problem description mapping from set description (utility?)
\subsubsection{$0/1$ Problem Description}
An integer linear program is a special case of integer programming ``in which
unknowns are binary, and only the restrictions must be
satisfied''~\cite{wiki:IP}. According to~\cite{christofides1975}, the set cover
problem ``can be formulated as a [$0/1$] linear program'' as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \text{minimize} \sum\limits_{j=1}^N &c_j \xi_j\\
  \text{subject to} \sum\limits_{j=1}^N &t_{ij} \xi_j \geq 1 &\forall
  r_i \in \mathcal{R}
\end{align*}
where ${c_j \geq 0}$, ${\xi_j \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace}$, if ${S_j \notin
\mathcal{S}^\prime}$ or ${S_j \in \mathcal{S}^\prime}$ respectively, and ${t_{ij}
\in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace}$, if ${r_i \notin S_j}$ or ${r_i \in S_j}$
respectively~\cite[p. 39-40]{christofides1975}.

This is different from the set cover problem defined above in that we encode,
using binary representation, whether every set is in the set cover or not.
We assign a $1$ if the set is in the set cover, and a $0$ otherwise. This
provides a $\log{n}$-approximation algorithm for the minimum
set cover problem~\cite{wiki:SCP}.

% PD Problem Domain complexity (search space, solution space)
\subsubsection{Problem Domain Complexity} \label{sec:pdComplex}

In 1972, Karp, et al. proved that the set cover problem is
NP-Complete~\cite{karp1972}, while the optimization version is
NP-Hard~\cite{wiki:SCP}. According to \cite{wiki:SCP, lamontSCP}, the
complexity of the set cover problem is the powerset of $\mathcal{S}$, that is
${\bigoh{2^{|\mathcal{S}|}} \rightarrow \bigoh{2^N}}$, for both the search and
solution spaces. This is due to the fact that a solution is found, if it
exists, only by searching the space of all possible combinations of
$\mathcal{S}$.

% Problem Domain specification (Input and Output domains, Conditions,...)
\subsubsection{Problem Domain Specification}
Using the symbolic notation developed in Section~\ref{sec:symbol} we define the
input and output domains and conditions for the set cover problem domain.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] $D_i$ : $(\mathcal{R,S})$
  \item[] $\mathcal{R}$ : set of $m$ elements $r$
  \item[] $\mathcal{S}$ : set of $N$ sets with costs $c$ that may cover
    $\mathcal{R}$
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[] set cover : $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^k S_{j_i} =
        \mathcal{R}$~\cite[Eq.~3.12]{christofides1975}\\ 
        -- union of sets cover $\mathcal{R}$
        elements
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[] $D_o$ : set of set-covers $\mathcal{S}^\prime$ of $\mathcal{R}$ with
    additive cost
\end{enumerate}

Solution:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] Minimize additive cover costs subject to following constraints:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[-] set cover:\\
        $\sum\limits_{j=1}^N t_{ij} \xi_j \geq 1, \quad i =
        1,2,\ldots,M$~\cite[Eq.  3.14]{christofides1975}\\
        cover all elements at least once
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\textsc{Application Problem Domain}} \label{sec:application}

% Application Problem Domain English discussion
\subsubsection{Application Problem Domain Discussion} \label{sec:APD}

The UAS problem deals with assigning UAS orbits to cover a list of targets.
Given a limited number of UAVs, each assigned to specific units based in
specific locations -- each with specific ranges of distance able to travel and
operating costs -- and a list of targets to surveil, how do we assign
surveillance orbits to the UASs such that all targets are surveilled while
keeping the UASs close enough to their base of operations that they may safely
return, either when their mission finishes or they've exhausted their fuel, at
minimum cost?  The UAS problem relates to the set cover problem in that we are
trying to cover a set of targets with a set of UAVs based on their locations,
all while keeping them within a specified distance of their home stations and
minimizing the associated operating costs. 

Formally, there exists a universe of targets that we want to surveil
${\mathcal{T} = \lbrace t_1,\ldots,t_m \rbrace}$, each with a specific hideout
location $t_{i_h}$, a set of UASs ${\mathcal{U} = \lbrace u_1,\ldots,u_n
\rbrace}$, each with an assigned squadron and operating cost, a set of
squadrons ${\mathcal{F} = \lbrace f_1,\ldots,f_q \rbrace}$ with specific
geographic locations $f_{j_\ell}$, and, finally, a set of schedules
${\mathcal{A} = \lbrace a_1,\ldots,a_r \rbrace}$ for each target which denote
time windows in which the target is able to be surveilled. The objective is to
surveil each target $t$ during their time window $a$ using a minimum number of
UASs ${u \in \mathcal{U}}$ at minimum cost $c$ such that each target is
surveilled.

A review of the available literature reveals that, while much research has been
performed on routing UASs and target coverage, none of the available sources
provide insight into the constrained problem defined in this section. The most
similar research can be found in~\cite{karakaya2014}, which uses a Max-Min Ant
System algorithm, a member of the ant colony optimization algorithm
family~\cite{wiki:aco}. Other research with related, but not similar, goals to
this project are discussed in~\cite{avellar2015, caillouet2010, carlyle2007,
quintero2010, semsch2009, sundar2013}.

% PD complexity
\subsubsection{Application Problem Domain Complexity}

Similar to the problem domain complexity described in
Section~\ref{sec:pdComplex}, the complexity of the application domain is the
powerset of each search space $\bigoh{2^{|\mathcal{T}|} \times
2^{|\mathcal{U}|} \times 2^{|\mathcal{F}|} \times 2^{|\mathcal{A}|}}
\rightarrow \bigoh{2^{m + n + q + r}}$, or every possible combination of
targets, UASs, squadrons, and surveillance time windows.

We now prove that the application domain, the UAS problem, is NP-Complete. This
can be shown using the technique described in~\cite{586textbook} in which the
constraints described in Section~\ref{sec:APD} are relaxed to facilitate a
polynomial-time reduction~\cite{wiki:polyReduction} into the form of a known
NP-Complete problem. This would allow a polynomial-time black-box solver for
the known NP-Complete problem, if one existed, to solve the relaxed-constraint
UAS problem. The UAS problem with relaxed constraints could then be said to be
at least as hard as NP-Complete.

Relaxing the constraints of the UAS problem results in a problem as follows:
given a universe, or set of targets, $\mathcal{R}$ a set of UASs $\mathcal{U}$,
and a family of sets $\mathcal{S}$, containing UASs available to surveil
specific targets. Assign to each $s \in \mathcal{S}$ an operating cost $c$. The
goal is then to surveil each target in $\mathcal{R}$ at minimum cost. This
transformation can be done in polynomial time.

The solution returned is easily verified by iterating through $\mathcal{R}$ and
checking that there is in fact a UAS $\in \mathcal{U}$ assigned to surveil that
target. The complexity of the verification is ${\bigoh{|\mathcal{R}| \times
|\mathcal{U}|}}$

Therefore, since we have shown that, in polynomial-time, the UAS problem can be
transformed to the set cover problem (a known NP-Complete problem),
${\mathit{UAS} \leq_p \mathit{Set\ Cover}}$, and we can verify in
polynomial-time the solution, the UAS problem is NP-Complete.

\section{\textsc{Algorithm and Problem Domain Initial Integrations}} \label{sec:initIntegration}

% Selection of deterministic algorithm
\subsection{Selection of Deterministic Algorithm} \label{sec:detAlg}

The deterministic algorithm used for this project is the A$^*$ search
algorithm. The heuristic function is defined the same way the classic greedy
approach to this problem is as per~\cite{wiki:SCP}, with the exception that the
heuristic is inverted, as done in~\cite{pjcvphw8}, due to the fact that A$^*$
chooses the next search node which has the $h(n)$ closest to $0$.  The
heuristic function developed for this project is defined as: \heuristic.  The
function for deciding which node to visit next is: \[ \text{minimize } f(n) =
g(n) + h(n), \]

\noindent where $g(n) = g(n^\prime) + c(n^\prime,n)$.

The following sections document the disciplined design approach found
in~\cite{lamontSCP, lamontDesign, lamontMIS} -- starting from the point of
choosing data structures (since the problem domain has already been covered in
Sections~\ref{sec:problemDomain} and~\ref{sec:application}) and finishing with
a coded implementation (see Section~\ref{sec:code}).

\subsubsection{A$^*$ Algorithm Domain Discussion}

The A$^*$ algorithm is a best first search algorithm~\cite{lamontBFS,
pearl1984} which is ``widely used in pathfinding and graph
traversal''~\cite{wiki:astar} which makes it ideal for our problem. The star
``refers to always finding the optimal solution''~\cite{lamontBFS}; it can be
modified to find the optim\emph{um} solution if termination is delayed. While
it ``is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to
attain better performance''~\cite{wiki:astar}, it is still suitable for our
purposes, especially when using an admissable heuristic to assist the search
process~\cite{pearl1984} as is done in this paper, and is easily adaptable to
work with set cover problem instantiations. 

What differentiates A$^*$ from other greedy best first search algorithms is
that it not only takes into account the distance to the goal (the $h(n)$
part of the algorithm), but it also takes the distance already
traveled from the start node to the current node as well in the ``$g(n)$ part of
the heuristic''~\cite{lamontBFS}.

\subsubsection{Data Structures and Operations} \label{sec:dataStructures}

For the A$^*$ search algorithm, we use the following data structures:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{Solution} : a structure that holds the current partial solution
  \item[] \emph{Target} : a structure that represents a target to surveil, with
    a geographic location
  \item[] \emph{UAS} : a structure that represents an available Unmanned
    Aircraft System with an assigned squadron and operating cost
  \item[] \emph{Squadron} : a squadron that ``owns'' one or more UASs with a
    geographic location
  \item[] \emph{Schedule} : a structure that represents one or more time
    windows, per target, for which the target is ``available'' to be surveilled
\end{enumerate}

Operations on the A$^*$ algorithm include the following, adapted
from~\cite{lamontAstarEx}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{next-state-generator} : the set of nodes explored (those in
    \emph{OPEN}) and the set of nodes expanded (those in \emph{CLOSED})
  \item[] \emph{set of candidates} : nodes in the frontier (\emph(OPEN) list)
    sorted by \heuristic
  \item[] \emph{selection function} : choose node $n^\prime$ with the smallest
    $f(n^\prime)$ and place it on the \emph{CLOSED} list. Place its descendents
    on the \emph{OPEN} list
  \item[] \emph{feasibility function} : all nodes are feasible because of the
    tableau construction~\cite{christofides1975}
  \item[] \emph{solution function} : a node is a solution if the sets it
    contains cover the set of targets
\end{enumerate}

This concludes the data structures and operations discussion of the A$^*$
algorithm. In the next section, we refine the data structures and algorithm
towards a complete, \emph{creative !} solution.

\subsubsection{Refinement}

Refining the A$^*$ algorithm towards a complete solution is the topic of this
section. We now refine the data structures using abstract data types and
provide more insight into the final form.

Data Structure Refinement:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{Solution} : a structure that holds the current partial solution
  \item[] \emph{Target} : a structure that represents a target to surveil, with
    a geographic location
  \item[] \emph{UAS} : a structure that represents an available Unmanned
    Aircraft System with an assigned squadron and operating cost
  \item[] \emph{Squadron} : a squadron that ``owns'' one or more UASs with a
    geographic location
  \item[] \emph{Schedule} : a structure that represents one or more time
    windows, per target, for which the target is ``available'' to be surveilled
  \item[] \emph{OPEN} : a priority queue which holds the set of candidates
  \item[] \emph{CLOSED} : a set containing nodes which have already been
    expanded
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Pseudocode} \label{sec:astarPseudo}

This section presents pseudocode for the deterministic A$^*$ search algorithm
describe in the preceding sections. The pseudocode can be seen in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:astar} and is based on the A$^*$ algorithm detailed
in~\cite{pearl1984}. It has been modified to delay termination as to find a
complete solution and to include the heuristic detailed in
Section~\ref{sec:detAlg}. It is adapted from the form found in~\cite{pjcvphw8}.

% Selection of stochastic algorithm
\subsection{Selection of Stochastic Algorithm}

Simulated annealing is the stochastic algorithm used in this project. A brief
introduction and review of simulated annealing follows in
Section~\ref{sec:SAD}, with the remaining subsections in this section devoted
to documenting the disciplined, top-down design approach found
in~\cite{lamontMIS, lamontDesign, lamontSCP} -- starting with data structure
choice (as the problem domain has already been discussed in
Sections~\ref{sec:problemDomain} and~\ref{sec:application}) and finishing with
a coded implementation (see Section~\ref{sec:code}).

\subsubsection{Simulated Annealing Algorithm Domain Discussion} \label{sec:SAD}

Simulated annealing, according to~\cite{wiki:SA}, ``is a probablistic technique
for approximating the global optimum of a given function [and a] metaheuristic
to approximate global optimization in a large search space.'' The algorithm
takes its cue from a process known as annealing in metallurgy~\cite{lamontSA},
modeling the cooling of metals as the atoms of superheated metals gradually
progress towards an equilibrium as the metal cools~\cite{talbi2009,
wiki:metal}.  Consequently, the key to the simulated annealing algorithm is the
temperature, which is controlled via a cooling schedule. The cooling schedule
is responsible for allowing the search to escape from local optimals and
gradually decreases the temperature to slow the exploration of the search space
to the global optimum~\cite{lamontSA, talbi2009}. A generic simulated annealing
model with standard search constructs is presented in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:SAmodel}.

A difficulty encountered when implementing the simulated annealing algorithm is
the concept of neighborhood selection. Considered an art-form by
some~\cite{hw9}, selecting the neighborhood provides the local search aspect of
the algorithm while the cooling schedule allows it to search globally as well,
leading to the global optim\emph{um}~\cite{wiki:SA}.

\subsubsection{Data Structures and Operations} \label{sec:SAdata}

For the simulated annealing algorithm we use the following data structures:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{Solution} : a structure that holds the current partial solution
  \item[] \emph{Target} : a structure that represents a target to surveil, with
    a geographic location
  \item[] \emph{UAS} : a structure that represents an available Unmanned
    Aircraft System with an assigned squadron and operating cost
  \item[] \emph{Squadron} : a squadron that ``owns'' one or more UASs with a
    geographic location
  \item[] \emph{Schedule} : a structure that represents one or more time
    windows, per target, for which the target is ``available'' to be surveilled
\end{enumerate}

Operations on the simulated annealing algorithm include the following, adapted
from~\cite{lamontSAGS}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{next-state-generator} : generation uses mutation operating on
    current individual according to some probability
  \item[] \emph{set of candidates} : a solution
  \item[] \emph{selection function} : select from current solution for next
    generation solution
  \item[] \emph{feasibility function} : check new population child for
    feasibility (done by construction)
  \item[] \emph{solution function} : population members are feasible solutions
    by construction
  \item[] \emph{fitness function} : reflects symbolic problem domain
    optimization goal
\end{enumerate}

This concludes the data structures and operations discussion of the simulated
annealing algorithm. Once again, in the next section we refine the data
structures and algorithm towards a complete, \emph{creative !} solution.


\subsubsection{Simulated Annealing Algorithm Refinement}

We refine the simulated annealing algorithm by specifying more specific data
structures defined in Section~\ref{sec:SAdata}. The data structure refinement
follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[] \emph{Solution} : a set that holds the current partial solution
  \item[] \emph{Target} : a structure that represents a target to surveil, with
    a geographic location
  \item[] \emph{UAS} : a structure that represents an available Unmanned
    Aircraft System with an assigned squadron and operating cost
  \item[] \emph{Squadron} : a squadron that ``owns'' one or more UASs with a
    geographic location
  \item[] \emph{Schedule} : a structure that represents one or more time
    windows, per target, for which the target is ``available'' to be surveilled
  \item[] \emph{Temperature} : an integer representation of the temperature
    used in the cooling schedule function
\end{enumerate}

This refinement enables us to now provide a pseudocoded implementation, which
follows in Section~\ref{sec:SAPseudo}.

\subsubsection{Pseudocode} \label{sec:SAPseudo}

The pseudocode implementation presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:SA} is adapted
from~\cite{lamontSAGS} to solve the UAS problem described in this project.

This section reports the results from testing the designed algorithms on small
and medium input data. The data used in these experiments was derived from
unclassified Air Force UAS mission sets. The input files can be seen in the
GitHub repository created for this project.

Experiments for this project were designed in accordance with the guidelines
set forth in~\cite{barr2001}. Each algorithm was run $100$ times on each of the
three input files. Times reported in Tables~\ref{tab:astarResults}
and~\ref{tab:SAResults} are averaged over all $100$ program executions.

An Apple MacBook Pro equipped with a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 16 GB
of 1600 MHz DDR3 RAM running Mac OS X version 10.11.4 was used to run all
experiments.

The experience gained in performing this top-down program design relates very
well to the educational goals outlined in~\cite{lamontSyllabus}. Performing the
work for this paper provided an understanding of the SCP problem domain,
concept, classification and design integration. I have gained a better
understanding of deterministic and stochastic algorithmic search techniques and
theability to describe and use the A$^*$ deterministic and simulated annealing
stochastic search techniques. This paper has also provided me an opportunity to
us heuristic global and local search methods. Finally, through this paper and
the assigned class homeworks, I have gained an understanding and ability to
refine general search algorithms to solve specific problem types, all while
integrating proper data structures along with appropriate heuristics. 

The experimental design results show that the chosen algorithm implementations
solve the UAS problem presented. Further optimizations of the algorithms can be
performed to improve the given results, keeping in mind the
NFL~\cite{collet2007, wiki:nfl, igel2014} and is left for future work.

Overall, this project cemented many of the educational goals layed out
in~\cite{lamontSyllabus} and provided an opportunity to put the ideas and
concepts of algorithm design and metaheuristics to practical use.
